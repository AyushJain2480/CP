This code implements a fast power function that calculates the value of a^b for large numbers a and b with a modulus of 1000000007.

The code takes advantage of the property that (a^b) % n = ((a%n)^b) % n, where n is the modulus, to perform the calculation efficiently.

Instead of performing a linear time calculation with a for-loop, this code uses a more efficient approach based on the binary representation of the power b.

The code uses the bitwise operator & and the right shift operator >> to perform the binary calculation. The final result is stored in the ans variable and is returned as the output of the function.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int fastPow(long long a, long long b)
{
long long ans = 1;
int n = 1000000007; // Largest prime in Integer range
while(b > 0)
{
// if b is odd
if((b&1) != 0) // you can use if(b%2!=0) but bitwise & operator is faster than the modulo
{
ans = (ans * (a % n)) % n; // a . a^(b-1)
}
// if b is even
a = ((a%n)*(a%n))% n; // like a = a ^ 2
b = b>>1; // b ko half karre he b = b/2 karskte he par right shift fast hota he
}
return ans;
}

int main()
{
int a = 34657;
int b = 44444;
cout<< fastPow(a,b) <<endl;
return 0;
}
